# slack_weather

A weather bot made for Slack to help me practice and understand API usage.

Using the Slack web API, I can call upon the bot using "!weather". The bot listens to this, and takes the text following
as a location (i.e. toronto).  The bot then searches for that location in Canada, and can return information (temperature,
weather, sunset, visibility, etc.)

Must set up environment local environment variables to work currently.
